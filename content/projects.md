### Magic Mirror

We are currently working on creating a [Magic Mirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror). When we're done, you'll be able to see it hanging in the upstairs lobby of Otto Miller Hall, on the SPU campus.

### Scrapyard

One of the projects that we are currently working on is Scrapyard. Scrapyard is a voxel based game that we are creating using Unreal Engine 4. The game is called Scrapyard because the player will have a modular weapon that allows them to find, and attach different mods to their weapon. With these mods the player will be able to create unique weapons with different capabilities.
