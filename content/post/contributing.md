Have something you want to share with the SPU Developers community, maybe a how-to guide, or a review of some cool program you found, or even outlining a program you wrote yourself? Something that would fit nicely on a website like this? Or maybe you found something odd on the site, some bug that needs to be fixed, and want to let us know.

This website's source is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/SPUDevelopers/spudweb2), so it is easy to do all of the above.

### Issues And Suggestions

First of all, if you have a suggestion or a bug to report, let us know on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/SPUDevelopers/spudweb2/issues). This requires a GitHub account, which you can [register for free](https://github.com/join), if you don't already have one.

If you're reporting a bug, please give sufficient details about what the bug is as well as how we can reproduce it. In particular, please include the following information:

- Your web browser, version, and operating system (Edge on Windows 10, Firefox 53 on Linux, Safari on macOS Sierra, etc.)
- What page you were on, if applicable. If it occurs on all pages, please specify that instead.
- If the bug only appears under certain conditions or after specific actions are taken, please specify those here
  - For instance, if toggling the mobile menu on and off five times makes the toggle disappear, you should tell us that it happens only after toggling the menu five times.

If you're providing a suggestion on how to improve the site, such as new behavior, content, or something else that is not a bug, please provide the following instead:

- The suggestion itself
- Why we should implement it - why would it be useful?
- If applicable, how many people do you honestly expect to use the new behavior?

**Please note:** Because Hugo, the program we use to generate the website, separates themes from sites, some bugs and suggestions may not be able to be implemented by us. Bugs related to the theme should be directed there instead, and any features that do not apply solely to SPU Developers can be directed there as well.

### Content

If you want to contribute content to the website, the easiest method for us would be for you to [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), make your changes, and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). If the content would be a considerable amount of work, please contact us through [Slack](https://spudevelopers.slack.com) or in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SPUDevelopers/spudweb2/issues) with your idea before starting. If we can't include your content for some reason, we don't want you to have gone through that work for nothing!

Assuming you have received the go-ahead from a club leader to make your contribution, you'll want to set up a few things:

- Set up [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) ([Windows-specific directions](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/installing-on-windows/))
- Set up a Git environment on your computer. For Windows and Mac, we recommend using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) application.
- Familiarize yourself with using Hugo. Some helpful links in the Hugo docs (though you should explore some of the other pages, too!):
  - [Introduction](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/)
  - [Usage](http://gohugo.io/overview/usage/)
  - [Front Matter](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) (aka page metadata)
  - [Content Organization](http://gohugo.io/content/organization/)

That's a lot of content in a lot of links, so we'll wait here while you go through all of it.

You're done?
