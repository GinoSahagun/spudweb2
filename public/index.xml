      <description>Scrapyard One of the projects that we are currently working on is Scrapyard. Scrapyard is a voxel based game that we are creating using Unreal Engine 4. The game is called Scrapyard because the player will have a modular weapon that allows them to find, and attach different mods to their weapon. With these mods the player will be able to create unique weapons with different capabilities.</description>
